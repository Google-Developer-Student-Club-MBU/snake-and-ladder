  <ol type="1" start:"1"</ol>
  <li> Players take turns rolling the dice and moving their game piece forward by the number shown on the dice.</li>
  <li>The game board is marked with a series of ladders and snakes. When a player's piece lands on the base of a ladder, they get to climb the ladder and advance to the square at the ladder's top. Conversely, if they land on the head of a snake, they must slide down to the square at the snake's tail.</li>
  <li>The game also features a "winner's square" at the end, typically numbered 100 or the highest number on the board. To win, a player must roll the exact number needed to reach this square. If the dice roll is more than what's needed, the player must wait until their next turn to try again.</li>
